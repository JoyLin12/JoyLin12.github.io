### CPSC 120

#### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2
  This is my favorite lab because this is my very first time actually coding. I was very confused at first on what I was suppose to do but after getting some help, I understood how to declare a variable and how to use std::cin and std::cout. It was a very interesting experience.

* Lab 7
  This is my second faviorte labs because we used a lot of if statements. This helped me better understand how to use if statements and operators, like ||, &&, <=, and more. I faced some challenging errors but I was able to find the problem and fix it.

* Lab 8, part 2
  This is my third favorite lab because this was the first lab we used for loop in. This helped me understand how to create a loop and this loop helped me understand why we need ++i. I liked this lab because it created a cool pattern that I didn't know  you could do with coding.
